# Bio
I'm a second-year CS Ph.D. student at UIUC, advised by Prof. [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). 
The long-term goal of my research is to build AI systems capable of effectively interacting with external entities (e.g., tools, humans) in the environment to address challenges that remain unresolved even for human capabilities.

To achieve this goal, my current research primarily concentrates on multimodal and large language models, aiming to establish fundamental approaches to address the following challenges:
- **Alignment**: How can we train AI systems to follow human intents?
- **Interaction**: How can we train AI systems to effectively interact with external entities in the environment to facilitate the acquisition of information and dynamic planning?
- **Evaluation**: How can we evaluate AI systems in tasks where they surpass the capabilities of non-expert human counterparts?





In my undergraduate years, I was a research intern at [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn) advised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), working on trustworthy NLP. 
In the early stages of my research, I worked closely with Dr. [Fanchao Qi](https://fanchao-qi.github.io/) and received great help from him. Also, I am delighted to work with Prof. [Wei Wei](https://www.eric-weiwei.com) and Prof. [Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/). 



I'm excited about the discussion and collaboration! Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested or have questions about my work.

<!-- **Reviewer**: NeurIPS 2023, ARR 2023 (Feb, Apr), ACL 2023, IEEE T-IFS, NeurIPS 2022, EMNLP 2022, ARR 2022 (Dec) My research goal is to develop general-purpose models that can follow human instructions to solve tasks in a zero- or few-shot manner. I identify two important directions towards this goal and focus my research on (1) How to effectively acquire knowledge from web-scale data? (2) How to elicit the knowledge stored in pre-trained models to perform downstream tasks? 2 papers accepted to EMNLP 2022.[2022.9]. 2 papers accepted to NeurIPS 2022 (1 Spotlight).[2022.8]. Start my PhD journey at UIUC!![2022.4]. 1 paper accepted to NAACL 2022 (findings).[2021.8]. 3 papers accepted to EMNLP 2021. [2021.5]. 2 papers accepted to ACL 2021 (1 findings).I work on multimodal and large language models, basically focusing on three high-level topics: - **Fundamental development**: How to effectively develop general-purpose pre-trained models that possess strong fundamental capabilities (e.g., reasoning)?- **Exploring and exploiting their extensive potential**: How to fully leverage the capabilities of models to address real-world challenges?- **In-depth analysis**: How to systematically evaluate and interpret the behaviors of models? -->



# Personal
When I was young (around 20), I enjoyed playing the piano and basketball. When I started doing research, my interests changed and I quickly fell in love with food and soap operas. But always, I am a big fan of milk tea!!
